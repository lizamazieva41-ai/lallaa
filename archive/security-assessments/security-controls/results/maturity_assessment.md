## Current Assessment by Domain

### Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
**Current Level**: 2
**Strengths**: Basic policies defined, some compliance checking
**Gaps**: No formal risk management, limited compliance automation
**Recommendations**: Implement GRC tools, formal risk assessment

### Security Architecture and Engineering
**Current Level**: 2
**Strengths**: Basic security controls implemented, some secure design principles
**Gaps**: No security architecture reviews, ad-hoc implementations
**Recommendations**: Establish security architecture review board

### Security Operations and Vulnerability Management
**Current Level**: 2
**Strengths**: Basic monitoring in place, some vulnerability management
**Gaps**: Limited incident response, no continuous security testing
**Recommendations**: Implement SOC, automate security operations

### Threat Intelligence
**Current Level**: 1
**Strengths**: Basic threat awareness
**Gaps**: No threat intelligence program, no security monitoring
**Recommendations**: Establish threat intelligence capabilities

### Data Security and Privacy
**Current Level**: 3
**Strengths**: Encryption implemented, basic data protection
**Gaps**: Limited data classification, no DLP controls
**Recommendations**: Implement comprehensive data protection program

### Identity and Access Management
**Current Level**: 2
**Strengths**: Basic authentication, some access controls
**Gaps**: No identity management system, weak authentication
**Recommendations**: Implement IAM, MFA, identity lifecycle management

### Application Security
**Current Level**: 2
**Strengths**: Basic secure coding practices, some testing
**Gaps**: No automated security testing, limited DevSecOps
**Recommendations**: Implement SAST/DAST in CI/CD, secure development lifecycle

### Infrastructure Security
**Current Level**: 3
**Strengths**: Network security basics, container security
**Gaps**: Limited advanced protection, no zero-trust
**Recommendations**: Implement zero-trust architecture, advanced monitoring

### Training and Awareness
**Current Level**: 2
**Strengths**: Basic security awareness
**Gaps**: No formal training program, no security culture
**Recommendations**: Implement comprehensive security training program
